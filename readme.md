# Chisel Multiplexers

Here is code examples of every mux function in chisel. Explanation are available on the [Chisel Multiplexers Tutorial](https://learn-fpga-easily.com/chisel-multiplexers-tutorial).

This project use the workflow developped in this article [From HDL to FPGA Bitstream with Open Source toolchain](https://learn-fpga-easily.com/from-hdl-to-fpga-bitstream-with-open-source-toolchain/) on the blog [Learn Fpga Easily](https://learn-fpga-easily.com/)
